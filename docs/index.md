# Neural Circuit Extraction and Modular Composition Framework

Welcome to the documentation for the Neural Circuit Extraction and Modular Composition Framework, an open-source project focused on extracting interpretable neural circuits from transformer models and composing them to create more transparent, modular AI systems.

## Project Vision

We aim to advance AI interpretability and modularity by:

1. Training specialized transformer models on carefully constructed tasks
2. Extracting neural circuits that implement specific cognitive functions
3. Creating a database of reusable, documented circuit components
4. Developing a composition framework for building new capabilities from existing circuits
5. Evaluating system performance on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)

Our approach is inspired by Fran√ßois Chollet's work on measuring intelligence through skill-acquisition efficiency rather than task-specific performance.
