# Optimized Transformer Architecture

Our system employs highly optimized transformer architectures designed for algorithmic tasks, with a focus on efficiency, interpretability, and modularity.

## Base Model

The foundation of our system is an efficient, decoder-only transformer architecture:

- **Small, Efficient Models**: Initial experiments focus on models similar to those used in grokking studies (~400K parameters, 2 layers, 128 width)
- **Gradual Scaling**: We incrementally scale model size as needed for more complex tasks
- **Decoder-Only Design**: Our models use the decoder-only architecture, suitable for sequential algorithmic tasks

## Performance Optimizations

To maximize efficiency and performance, we integrate several key optimizations:

### FlashAttention Integration

We utilize the FlashAttention algorithm to significantly accelerate attention computation:

- **IO-Aware Implementation**: Optimizes memory access patterns for GPUs
- **Reduced Memory Footprint**: Avoids materializing large attention matrices
- **Improved Throughput**: Much faster training and inference, especially for longer sequences

### Advanced Attention Mechanisms

We experiment with various attention variants to improve capacity and efficiency:

- **Multigroup/Multilatent Attention**: Processes different aspects of inputs concurrently
- **Potential MoE Attention**: Mixture-of-Experts attention layers for specialized processing
- **Attention Optimizations**: Various optimizations for speed and parameter efficiency

These advanced attention mechanisms can lead to more modular internal representations, which is beneficial for our circuit extraction goals.

## Efficiency and Modularity Techniques

Beyond basic architectural choices, we employ several techniques to enhance efficiency and modularity:

### Model Pruning

We investigate various pruning techniques to identify minimal circuits:

- **Structured Pruning**: Remove entire heads or layers
- **Unstructured Pruning**: Remove individual weights (magnitude pruning, iterative pruning)
- **During/Post-Training**: Apply pruning during or after training

Pruning offers several benefits:
- Identifies and removes redundant parameters (30-50%+ reduction target)
- Reveals minimal, essential sub-circuits for tasks
- Improves inference efficiency
- Potentially simplifies circuit extraction

### LoRA Adapters (Low-Rank Adaptation)

We explore using LoRA to efficiently fine-tune models for specific algorithmic tasks:

- **Parameter Efficiency**: Updates only 0.1-1% of total parameters
- **Modularity**: Isolates task-specific knowledge in adapters
- **Extraction Benefits**: Potentially facilitates cleaner circuit extraction from the adapters themselves

LoRA adapters allow for rapid task specialization without full model retraining, making them ideal for our modular approach.

### Modular Design Philosophy

Our transformer is architected with modularity in mind:

- **Swappable Components**: Attention heads and FFN layers are conceptually interchangeable
- **Clean Interfaces**: Well-defined interfaces between components
- **Isolation**: Mechanisms to isolate and study specific parts of the network

This modular design philosophy facilitates experimentation and potentially enables more direct forms of circuit swapping in composed systems.

## Implementation

Our current implementation uses a simple transformer model with standard attention. Below is a simplified example of our attention mechanism:

```python
class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_attention_heads = config.num_attention_heads
        self.attention_head_size = config.hidden_size // config.num_attention_heads
        self.all_head_size = self.num_attention_heads * self.attention_head_size
        
        self.query = nn.Linear(config.hidden_size, self.all_head_size)
        self.key = nn.Linear(config.hidden_size, self.all_head_size)
        self.value = nn.Linear(config.hidden_size, self.all_head_size)
        
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(config.attention_probs_dropout_prob)
        self.out = nn.Linear(config.hidden_size, config.hidden_size)
        
    def forward(self, hidden_states, attention_mask=None):
        # Implementation of multi-head attention
        # ...
        return attention_output
```
