# Training Pipeline

Our training pipeline is designed to efficiently train models on diverse algorithmic tasks while capturing valuable information about learning dynamics.

## Concurrent Training Framework

We implement a robust system for running multiple training experiments in parallel:

- **Distributed Training**: Use orchestration tools (Ray, Kubernetes, SLURM) to schedule and manage concurrent training runs
- **Resource Management**: Track GPU/TPU usage and optimize job packing for efficient cluster utilization
- **Experiment Tracking**: Monitor and log training progress across multiple experiments

This framework allows us to:
- Test many hyperparameter combinations efficiently
- Train models on different tasks simultaneously 
- Compare learning dynamics across tasks and model configurations

## Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO)

We integrate automated hyperparameter optimization to find optimal training configurations:

- **HPO Libraries**: Utilize tools like Optuna, Ray Tune, or Weights & Biases Sweeps
- **Key Parameters**: Optimize learning rate, weight decay, batch size, optimizer betas, scheduler parameters
- **Metrics**: Focus on optimizing for rapid generalization (grokking speed) and final validation accuracy

Our HPO approach is tightly integrated with the concurrent training framework to maximize resource efficiency.

## Optimization Strategy

Our training approach employs techniques known to aid generalization in algorithmic tasks:

### Optimizer Selection
- **AdamW**: Use AdamW as our primary optimizer for its robustness
- **Controlled Weight Decay**: Apply appropriate weight decay to promote generalization
- **Parameter Tuning**: Carefully tune optimizer parameters for each task

### Learning Dynamics Techniques
- **Learning Rate Schedules**: Implement linear warmup followed by cosine decay
- **Gradient Clipping**: Prevent instability during training
- **Gradient Noise Injection**: Selectively add noise to aid exploration during optimization

These techniques are particularly important for observing phenomena like grokking (delayed generalization) on algorithmic tasks.

## Monitoring & Comprehensive Logging

We implement detailed logging to track and analyze model behavior:

### Metrics Tracking
- **Basic Metrics**: Training/validation loss and accuracy
- **Advanced Metrics**: Parameter norms, gradient norms, per-class accuracy
- **Learning Phenomena**: Track indicators of overfitting, grokking, and double descent

### Visualization Tools
- **Learning Curves**: Plot training/validation metrics over time
- **Parameter Distribution**: Visualize weight distributions during training
- **Activation Patterns**: Track neuron activations on key examples

### Integration with External Tools
- **Weights & Biases/TensorBoard**: Use these tools for experiment tracking and visualization
- **Custom Dashboards**: Create specialized views for analyzing algorithmic learning

## Implementation

Our current implementation uses PyTorch for training models on algorithmic tasks. Below is a simplified example of our training loop:

```python
class AlgorithmicTaskTrainer:
    def __init__(self, model, train_dataset, test_dataset, optimizer=None, 
                 lr_scheduler=None, batch_size=64, max_epochs=10000, 
                 patience=1000, device="cuda", log_interval=100):
        # Initialize trainer with model, datasets, optimizer, etc.
        # ...
    
    def train_epoch(self):
        """Train for one epoch and return average loss and accuracy"""
        self.model.train()
        total_loss = 0.0
        correct_predictions = 0
        total_predictions = 0
        
        for batch_idx, (input_ids, target_ids) in enumerate(self.train_dataloader):
            # Move data to device
            input_ids = input_ids.to(self.device)
            target_ids = target_ids.to(self.device)
            
            # Forward pass
            self.optimizer.zero_grad()
            logits = self.model(input_ids)
            
            # Compute loss
            loss = self.criterion(logits.view(-1, logits.size(-1)), target_ids.view(-1))
            
            # Backward pass
            loss.backward()
            self.optimizer.step()
            
            # Update statistics
            # ...
            
        return avg_loss, avg_accuracy
    
    def train(self):
        """Main training loop with early stopping and checkpointing"""
        # Implementation of full training loop
        # ...
```

## Future Directions

Future work on the training pipeline includes:

1. **Full-Scale Distributed Training**: Scale to large clusters for more extensive experiments
2. **Advanced HPO Techniques**: Implement Bayesian and population-based HPO methods
3. **Curriculum Learning**: Develop progressive training curricula for complex tasks
4. **Multi-Task Training**: Train models on multiple related tasks simultaneously
5. **Learning Dynamics Analysis**: More sophisticated analysis of grokking and other phenomena
