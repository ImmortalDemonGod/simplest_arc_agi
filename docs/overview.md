# Project Overview

## Vision and Goals

This project aims to build an automated, scalable system designed to advance our understanding of how neural networks learn, represent, and compose algorithms. The system integrates automatic data generation for diverse algorithmic tasks, concurrent training of highly optimized transformer models, advanced circuit extraction techniques, and a novel modular composition framework leveraging a cataloged library of neural circuits. 

The ultimate goal is to explore the potential for bootstrapping complex, abstract reasoning capabilities from simpler, verifiable learned components, potentially bridging the gap between emergent neural computation and structured algorithmic problem-solving.

## Core Goals

1. **Automatically Generate Diverse Algorithmic Task Data**  
   Create structured datasets for a wide spectrum of algorithmic tasks, ranging from simple binary operations (e.g., `a ◦ b = c` for grokking studies) to more complex problems involving sequences, grids, or compositions of functions, leveraging primitives like those found in `arc_types`.

2. **Train Optimized Transformer Models Concurrently**  
   Efficiently execute numerous training experiments across multiple tasks and model configurations simultaneously, leveraging state-of-the-art hardware (GPUs/TPUs) and distributed frameworks (e.g., Ray, Kubernetes, SLURM) to study learning dynamics and generate models for circuit analysis.

3. **Employ Highly Optimized and Adaptable Architectures**  
   Utilize cutting-edge transformer optimizations (e.g., FlashAttention) and explore architectural modifications (e.g., advanced attention mechanisms) alongside techniques like model pruning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enhance efficiency, isolate core computational circuits, facilitate rapid task specialization, and create models amenable to modular analysis.

4. **Extract and Catalog Interpretable Neural Circuits**  
   Apply advanced circuit extraction methods (e.g., cross-layer transcoding via dictionary learning, attribution graph construction) to identify, interpret, and systematically catalog the neural circuits responsible for specific algorithmic capabilities within trained models, storing them in a structured database.

5. **Enable Modular Composition of Circuits**  
   Treat the cataloged circuits as functional building blocks with defined interfaces. Develop methods to compose these modules—analogous to software engineering—to represent and potentially execute arbitrarily complex algorithms. This includes exploring code-like representations for composed circuits and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for composition assistance, aiming to overcome the complexity limitations of individual fixed-capacity models.

## Motivation

Understanding how neural networks perform algorithmic reasoning is crucial for building more reliable, interpretable, and capable AI systems. Phenomena like "grokking" (delayed generalization on simple algorithmic tasks) highlight gaps in our understanding of optimization dynamics and generalization in overparameterized models. 

By systematically extracting, cataloging, and composing the underlying circuits, we aim to:

- **Gain deeper insights into learning dynamics**, including grokking, double descent, and the emergence of algorithmic structures.
- **Develop a framework for building complex reasoning systems** from verifiable, learned components, drawing parallels with modular software engineering.
- **Create a unique testbed for interpretability research**, circuit analysis techniques, and modular AI design principles.
- **Explore the limits of algorithmic complexity** learnable by fixed-capacity models versus composed systems built from simpler, reusable circuits.
- **Bridge the gap between sub-symbolic neural computation and symbolic algorithmic reasoning** by representing circuits in a more structured, potentially code-like format.

## Key Innovations

The key innovation in this system is the **explicit extraction, cataloging, and structured composition of learned, emergent algorithmic primitives into verifiable programs**. 

Traditional programming uses explicitly defined, human-coded functions. Standard deep learning uses (mostly) monolithic, end-to-end trained models where intermediate steps are emergent but not explicitly extracted, cataloged, or composed in a structured, verifiable way. Our system bridges this gap by:

1. Learning neural implementations of algorithmic primitives
2. Extracting and cataloging these as manipulable components  
3. Composing them into novel configurations to solve new problems
4. Providing verifiable reasoning traces for the composed systems
